# GPT-prompts

I will store here some efficient prompts for chat GPT 3.5 focusing mainly on code writing.
My ultimate goal with this prompts is to enable anyone, no matter your experience, to produce good quality code.

As of now chat GPT will start to loose some context after ten's or so reponses. 
I value the efficiency as how much answers are needed from chat GPT to produce good quality code that respond to a product requirement.
To add some challenge as of now chat GPT 3.5 have a 2048 character limit.


Explanations :
  - {} : Brackets hold a variable, replace the bracket with the value you need. I will provide inside the brackets some examples.
  - // : Double slashes are here to annotate and explain something either on se same line prior to the double slashes or on the following line if nothing comes prior to the double slashes
  - /*
     *   : This is a multiline annotation, same as the double slashes
     */
  - () : 	Parenthesis mark an optional text. They might be followed by an annotation to explain the context to use it.
