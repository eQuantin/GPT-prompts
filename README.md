I will store here some efficient prompts for chat GPT 3.5 forcusing mainly on code writing

As of now chat GPT will start to loose some context after ten's or so reponses. 
I evalue the efficiency as how fast can chat GPT produce good quality code that respond to a product requirement.
To add some challenge as of now chat GPT 3.5 have a 2048 character limit.
